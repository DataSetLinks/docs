## Introduction

The DataLinks Query Language is a powerful domain-specific language designed to query and manipulate datasets within the DataLinks ecosystem. It provides a flexible and intuitive way to access data, apply filters, establish relationships between datasets, and sort results.

This language is particularly useful for:
- Retrieving data from specific datasets
- Filtering data based on various conditions
- Discovering relationships between different datasets
- Traversing complex data structures
- Sorting and limiting result sets

## Basic Syntax

The query language follows a fluent interface pattern, where methods are chained together to build complex queries. The basic structure of a query is:

```js
Ontology("<dataset>").<operation1>().<operation2>()...
```

or

```js
OntologyObject("<dataset>").<operation1>().<operation2>()...
```

Both `Ontology` and `OntologyObject` are valid entry points for creating a query.

## Querying Datasets

### Basic Dataset Query

To query a dataset, specify its name:

```js
Ontology("Movies")
```

Dataset names are case-insensitive, so `Ontology("movies")` and `Ontology("Movies")` refer to the same dataset.

### Namespaced Datasets

Datasets can be organized in namespaces. To query a namespaced dataset, use the format:

```js
Ontology("Namespace/Dataset")
```

For example:
```js
Ontology("Companies/Orange")
```

If a dataset name is ambiguous (exists in multiple namespaces), you must specify the namespace to avoid errors.

## Filtering Data

### Basic Filtering

To filter data, use the `filter()` method with a comparison expression:

```js
Ontology("Movies").filter(year == 2012)
```

or

```js
Ontology("Movies").filter().column("year == 2012")
```

### Comparison Operators

The query language supports the following comparison operators:

- `==` (equal to)
- `!=` (not equal to)
- `<` (less than)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)
- `>` (greater than)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)

Examples:
```js
Ontology("Movies").filter(year < 2000)
Ontology("Movies").filter(budget >= 10000000)
Ontology("Movies").filter(name != "Titanic")
```

### Logical Operators

Combine multiple conditions using logical operators:

- `&&` (AND)
- `||` (OR)

Examples:
```js
Ontology("Movies").filter(year == 2005 && director == "Christopher Nolan")
Ontology("Movies").filter(year == 2005 || year == 2006)
```

### Nested Conditions

Use parentheses to create complex nested conditions:

```js
Ontology("Movies").filter(director == "Mark Osborne" && (year == 2005 || year == 2006))
```
### Filter Expression Syntax

The query language provides flexible syntax for filter expressions:

1. **Quoting Field Names**: Field names can be unquoted, single-quoted, or double-quoted:
```js
name == "value"
"name" == "value"
'name' == "value"
   ```

2. **Quoting Values**: String values can be unquoted (for simple strings) or quoted:
```js
title == dog
title == "dog"
title == 'dog'
   ```

3. **Multi-word Values**: Multi-word string values must be quoted:
```js
title == "The Matrix"
   ```

<Note>Note: Unquoted multi-word values (e.g., `title == The Matrix`) are not supported.</Note>


## Linking Datasets

### Searching Related Datasets

To find related datasets, use the `searchAround()` and `find()` methods:

```js
Ontology("Movies").searchAround().find("Actor")
```

This searches for actors related to movies based on defined links between the datasets.

### Specifying Search Depth

You can specify the depth of the search (how many hops to traverse):

```js
Ontology("Movies").searchAround(2).find("Actor")
```

A depth of 2 means it will look for relationships that are two links away.

### Following Specific Links

To follow specific columns when linking datasets:

```js
Ontology("Movies").searchAround().find("Actor").follow("director")
```

This specifies that the link between Movies and Actor should be through the "director" column.

You can specify multiple columns to follow:

```js
Ontology("Movies").searchAround().find("Actor").follow("director", "producer")
```

## Sorting and Limiting Results

### Sorting Results

Sort results in ascending or descending order:

```js
Ontology("Movies").sortAscending("year")
Ontology("Movies").sortDescending("budget")
```

Alternative syntax:

```js
Ontology("Movies").sort("year", "ASC")
Ontology("Movies").sort("budget", "DESC")
```

### Multiple Sort Criteria

Sort by multiple fields:

```js
Ontology("Actor").sortDescending("nationality").sortAscending("age")
```

This sorts actors first by nationality in descending order, then by age in ascending order.

### Limiting Results

Limit the number of results returned:

```js
Ontology("Movies").limit(5)
```

You can also limit results at different stages of a complex query:

```js
Ontology("Movies").limit(10).searchAround().find("Actor").limit(5)
```

This limits the movies to 10 and the related actors to 5.

## Natural Language Query Generation

The system can generate queries from natural language questions. For example:

Natural language: "What is the age of the director of Braveheart?"

Generated query:
```js
OntologyObject("Movies").filter(name == "Braveheart").searchAround().find("Actor")
```

## Examples

### Basic Query Examples

1. Find all movies:
```js
Ontology("Movies")
   ```

2. Find a specific movie:
```js
Ontology("Movies").filter(name == "Argo")
   ```

3. Find movies released before 2000:
```js
Ontology("Movies").filter(year < 2000)
   ```

### Relationship Query Examples

1. Find actors who directed movies:
```js
Ontology("Movies").searchAround().find("Actor")
   ```

2. Find movies directed by actors under 60:
```js
Ontology("Actor").filter(age < 60).searchAround().find("Movies")
   ```

3. Find actors who directed movies, then find other actors who worked with them:
```js
Ontology("Actor").filter(age < 60).searchAround().find("Movies").searchAround().find("Actor")
   ```

### Sorting and Limiting Examples

1. Find the 3 oldest movies:
```js
Ontology("Movies").sortAscending("year").limit(3)
   ```

2. Find the 5 highest budget movies:
```js
Ontology("Movies").sortDescending("budget").limit(5)
   ```
## **Error Handling**

If a query returns unexpected results:

1. Check field names and table relationships for correctness.

2. Ensure the depth in `searchAround` is sufficient for your query.

3. Debug by breaking the query into smaller parts and testing them individually.
