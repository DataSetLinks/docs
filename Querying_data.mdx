For data querying, you can send expressive queries to the backend that can filter, do search arounds, aggregations and more!

```
 1 curl -H "Authorization: Bearer token1234abcdefg"`
 2      -X POST https://api.datasetlinks.com/api/data/username/namespace/objectname
 3      --data 'OntologyObject("objectname").get()'
```

Line by line:

1 - You need to provide us with a Bearer token for your user. We don’t have a self service token generator yet, but you can ask the DataLinks team to give you one by reaching out to us -- [support@datasetlinks.com](mailto:support@datasetlinks.com).

2 - These three properties **username**/**namespace**/**objectname** can be found in the dataset URL path by clicking My Data on the left menu and navigating to the dataset you want to query.

3 - This line contains the query you want to run. The reason why this curl is a POST is so that you can send the query on the body. Our query language keeps growing and soon we’ll publish documentation for the whole feature space.

For the time-being, you can find the following examples below:

**Getting all data:**

```
OntologyObject("objectname").get()
```

**Filtering a column:**

```
OntologyObject("objectname").filter("columnName==Foo").get()
```

**Filter with Logic expressions:**

```
OntologyObject("objectname").filter("columnName==Foo && column2 > 2").get()
```

**Following links:**

```
OntologyObject("objectname").searchAround().find("otherObject").get()
```
