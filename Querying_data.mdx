# Querying Data with DataLinks

This guide explains how to query data in DataLinks using our powerful query language.

## Introduction to the Query Language

DataLinks provides an expressive query language that enables you to:
- Retrieve data from your datasets
- Filter data based on conditions
- Search for related data across connected datasets
- Follow links between entities
- Perform aggregations and transformations

Our query language is designed to be intuitive and powerful, allowing you to express complex relationships and queries with simple syntax.

## Query Structure

A typical DataLinks query follows this pattern:

1. Start with `OntologyObject()` to specify the dataset
2. Add operations like `filter()`, `searchAround()`, or `find()`
3. End with `get()` to execute the query and retrieve results

## Basic Query Operations

### Getting All Data

To retrieve all data from a dataset:

```
OntologyObject("datasetName").get()
```

This query returns all records from the specified dataset.

### Filtering Data

To filter data based on column values:

```
OntologyObject("datasetName").filter("columnName==Foo").get()
```

This query returns only records where the column "columnName" has the value "Foo".

### Using Logical Expressions

You can use logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) to create complex filter conditions:

```
OntologyObject("datasetName").filter("columnName==Foo && column2 > 2").get()
```

This query returns records where "columnName" equals "Foo" AND "column2" is greater than 2.

### Comparison Operators

The query language supports various comparison operators:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `==` | Equal to | `"year==2023"` |
| `!=` | Not equal to | `"status!=pending"` |
| `>` | Greater than | `"price>100"` |
| `<` | Less than | `"quantity<10"` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | `"age>=18"` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | `"discount<=50"` |

## Advanced Query Operations

### Following Links Between Datasets

One of the most powerful features of DataLinks is the ability to follow links between datasets:

```
OntologyObject("datasetName").searchAround().find("otherDataset").get()
```

This query:
1. Starts with the "datasetName" dataset
2. Searches for connected entities using `searchAround()`
3. Finds entities in the "otherDataset" dataset
4. Returns the results

### Specifying Search Depth

You can specify how far to search for connections:

```
OntologyObject("datasetName").searchAround(2).find("otherDataset").get()
```

This limits the search to connections that are at most 2 steps away.

### Following Specific Connections

To follow only specific connections:

```
OntologyObject("Movies").searchAround().find("Actors").follow("director").get()
```

This query finds actors connected to movies, but only through the "director" relationship.

## Example Queries

### Finding Movies by a Specific Director

```
OntologyObject("Directors")
  .filter("name=='Christopher Nolan'")
  .searchAround()
  .find("Movies")
  .get()
```

### Finding Transactions Above a Certain Amount

```
OntologyObject("Transactions")
  .filter("amount>1000 && date>='2023-01-01'")
  .get()
```

### Finding Companies Connected to a Specific Person

```
OntologyObject("People")
  .filter("name=='John Smith'")
  .searchAround(3)
  .find("Companies")
  .get()
```

## Query Response

The response to a query is a JSON object containing the matching records. The structure of the response depends on the query and the datasets involved.

## Performance Considerations

- Use specific filters to narrow down results
- Limit search depth with `searchAround(n)` for better performance
- For complex queries, consider breaking them into smaller parts

## Debugging Queries

If your query doesn't return the expected results:

1. Start with simpler queries and gradually add complexity
2. Check field names and relationships for correctness
3. Ensure the search depth is sufficient for your query
4. Verify that the data exists in the datasets you're querying
