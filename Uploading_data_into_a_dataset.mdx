<Warning>
  Before uploading data to a dataset you first need to create it!
  Please do so through [API](Creating_a_dataset), or find your datasets through the UI.
</Warning>

### Uploading structured data

Data can currently be uploaded by providing a structured JSON file. To upload data, you must have write permissions for the dataset. If it's a dataset you created, you automatically have these permissions. However, if the dataset belongs to someone else, you'll need to request write access.

While this functionality is supported, there is no user interface available for it at the moment. Until the UI is implemented, you can contact the DataLinks team to enable sharing permissions on the backend.
