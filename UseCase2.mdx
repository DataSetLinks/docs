### Use Case: Identifying Users Engaged in Radical Sports Before Activating Health Insurance

**Objective**: This use case demonstrates how to identify users who activated health insurance on a specific date, particularly those whose activation reasons suggest injury (e.g., "broken") and who previously interacted with services or left reviews related to dangerous or radical sports.

### **Example Query**

```
OntologyObject("InsuranceRequests")
    .filter(
        "insurance_type == 'Health' && " +
        "insurance_activation_reason.contains('broken') && " +
        "date_of_request == '2024-10-01'"
    ) // Filter users with health insurance requests due to injuries (reason contains 'broken') and made on 1st October 2024
    .find("ShopsReviews")
    .filter(
        "review_date >= '2024-09-01' && " +
        "review_date <= '2024-10-30'"
    ) // Match users based on reviews made within the relevant timeframe (September 1 - October 30, 2024)
    .find("Service")
    .filter(
        "NAICS_code == 713990 || " + // All other amusement and recreation industries (e.g., bungee jumping)
        "NAICS_code == 713940 || " + // Fitness and recreational sports centers
        "NAICS_code == 611620"        // Sports and recreation instruction (e.g., skydiving lessons)
    ) // Filter for services associated with radical or dangerous sports
    .select("user_name, insurance_activation_reason, service_name, review_date, NAICS_code")
    .get();
```

**User Name**: The name of the user with health insurance.
**Insurance Activation Reason**: The reason for activating the insurance.
**Service Name**: The name of the service related to radical sports.
