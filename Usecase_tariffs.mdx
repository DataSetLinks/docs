### Use Case: Querying Tariff Information for International Trade

**Objective**: This use case demonstrates how to use the DataLinks platform to query tariff information for international trade. The service provides up-to-date tariff rates, regulations, and related information to help businesses make informed decisions about importing and exporting goods.

### **Example Query**

You can query tariff information using natural language. For example:

```
"Import steel from Spain to the US"
```

This query will return relevant tariff information for steel products being imported from Spain to the United States.

### **How It Works**

The tariff service uses the DataLinks platform to:

1. Process natural language queries about tariffs
2. Search through comprehensive tariff databases
3. Return relevant, up-to-date tariff information
4. Charge users based on usage (per query)

### **API Integration**

The service is available through a REST API:

```
GET /api/query?q=Import%20steel%20from%20Spain%20to%20the%20US
```

Authentication is required using a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

### **Output Example**

### **Billing Information**

The service uses a usage-based billing model:
- Each query deducts from your account balance
