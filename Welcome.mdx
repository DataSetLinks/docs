# Welcome to DataLinks!

DataLinks is a platform which allows you to automatically interconnect your datasets as entities with defined business roles. Link your data with relevant datasets, capitalizing on our ever-growing database. 

Get ready to deliver deep meaningful insights into your data through our Semantic Layer Technology. Our platform is constantly improving and we will update the documentation accordingly.

To get started, click on [My Data](https://datalinks.tech/home/data), or find your datasets through the UI. On the tab to the left you'll find some additional documentation on how to interact with DataLinks via the API!
