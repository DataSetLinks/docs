# Welcome to DataLinks!

DataLinks is a platform which allows you to automatically interconnect your datasets as entities with defined business roles. Link your data with relevant datasets, capitalizing on our ever-growing database.

Get ready to deliver deep meaningful insights into your data through our Semantic Layer Technology. Our platform is constantly improving and we will update the documentation accordingly.

To get started, follow the next steps of this documentation. The basic flow is as follow:


<Steps>
    <Step title="Create dataset">
        Crete a dataset inside a namespace. We recommend creating a namespace for each project. Make sure the dataset is private unless you want to share it with others.
        [Read more](Creating_a_dataset)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Ingest data">
        Upload data to your dataset. You can use our [AI features](ai_inference) to automatically extract metadata from your data.
        [Read more](Uploading_data_into_a_dataset)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Query dataset">
        Once your data is ingested, you can query it using our [Semantic Layer](Querying_data).
    </Step>
