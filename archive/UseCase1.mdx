### Use Case: Detecting Potentially Explosive Locations Around a Specific Shop

**Objective**: This use case demonstrates how to identify potential hazards around a specific shop by detecting nearby gas stations or other businesses classified as potentially explosive based on their NAICS codes. For this example, we use "Shop A" as the target.

### **Example Query**

```
OntologyObject("Shops");
     .filter("name == 'Shop A'") // Filter for Shop A
     .searchAround(500) // Search within a 500-meter radius
    .find("Shops");
    .filter(
        "NAICS_code == 447110 || " +  // Gasoline stations with convenience stores
        "NAICS_code == 447190 || " +  // Other gasoline stations
        "NAICS_code == 454310 || " +  // Fuel dealers
        "NAICS_code == 32511 || " +   // Petrochemical manufacturing
        "NAICS_code == 325120 || " +  // Industrial gas manufacturing
        "NAICS_code == 324110 || " +  // Petroleum refineries
        "NAICS_code == 332996 || " +  // Ammunition manufacturing
        "NAICS_code == 424710"        // Petroleum bulk stations and terminals
     ) // Filter for potentially explosive NAICS codes
    .get();
```

### **Output Example**

The query results provide the following fields for each potentially hazardous location:

**Name**: The name of the business.

**NAICS Code**: The classification code for the type of business.

**Distance**: The distance from "Shop A" in meters.

**Risk Level** (<u>if added</u>): A classification of the risk (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

**Others**: Other columns, in case these weren't filtered beforehand.

| Name               | NAICS CODE | Distance (m) | Risk Level | (Others) |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | :------- |
| Fuel Station Alpha | 447110     | 250          | High       | ...      |
| Petrochem Plant B  | 32511      | 430          | High       | ...      |
| Ammunition Depot C | 332996     | 750          | Medium     | ...      |
