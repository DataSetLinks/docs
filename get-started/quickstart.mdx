## Introduction

This guide shows you how to use the DataLinks web platform to find shared opportunities across two North American data sources. You will learn by doing: uploading files, connecting records, and exploring the results directly in the platform.

<Info>
  This guide focuses on the web platform only. If you'd like to learn about using the DataLinks API and SDK kit, you can try our [API/SDK QuickStart guide](/get-started/quickstart-api) instead.

## Scenario

You're a sales manager for a dental products company in North America. Your goal is to see how your existing customer base overlaps with members of a major dental society to uncover new prospecting opportunities.

You'll work with two datasets:

- A JSON file that contains your current customers, including names, locations, and contact details — customer_list.json
- A dental society member list that includes dentists and clinic owners across the United States and Canada — society_list_web.txt

Using the DataLinks web platform, you'll ingest both datasets, view how they connect, and query the linked data to find customers who are also society members or have professional ties to them.

## Outcome

By the end of this guide, you will have a table showing which of your current customers also appear in the dental society list. You can explore these matches in the DataLinks platform or export them as a CSV file for follow-up.

This exercise helps you practice the full workflow in DataLinks: importing data, linking records, exploring relationships, and using the insights for focused outreach.

## Prerequisites

4. Enter namespace `dental_prospects`.
5. Ensure the Dataset visibility is set to **Private** using the toggle.
6. Click **Create dataset and upload data**.

<Check>
  Result: You've created an empty `customer_list` dataset inside the `dental_prospects` namespace.
</Check>

## Part 2: Upload the structured customer list

Now that you've created an empty dataset, you need to populate it with data. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click anywhere in the **Click to upload** area to open the file explorer.
2. Click the `customer_list.json` file you downloaded, then click **Open**.
3. Wait while DataLinks ingests your data.

## Part 3: Create a second dataset for the society members list

Now that you have your customer list uploaded, you need to upload the list of dental society members you want to compare it against.

1. Return to Home.
2. Click **Create New Dataset**.
3. Enter the following dataset name: `society_members`.
4. Enter namespace `dental_prospects`.
5. Ensure the Dataset visibility is set to **Private** using the toggle.
6. Click **Create dataset and upload data**.

## Part 4: Upload the unstructured society members list

Now that you've created your dataset for the society member list, you need to populate it with data. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click anywhere in the **Click to upload** area to open the file explorer.
2. Click the `society_members_web.txt` file you downloaded, then click **Open**.
3. Wait while DataLinks ingests your data.
4. Click the **eye icon** under Ingestion Results to review the data and confirm that everything looks correct.
