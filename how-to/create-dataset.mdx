Datasets are the foundation of how DataLinks organizes and understands your information. Each dataset represents a structured table of data that can later be cleaned, connected, and queried by AI.

If you’re new to DataLinks, you may want to start with the explanatory article [Datasets and Namespaces](/concepts/datasets-namespaces)  to learn how datasets fit within namespaces and the broader DataLinks structure.

## Create a dataset in the web platform

If you prefer a simple, guided setup, you can create a dataset directly in the DataLinks web platform.

Follow these steps:

1. **Log in** to your DataLinks account.
2. In the left navigation menu, click **Create a New Dataset**.
3. **Enter a name** for your dataset. Choose something descriptive, such as “customer_transactions_2025.”

   <Info>
     Use underscores, not spaces, when creating names.
   </Info>
4. **Select or enter a namespace** to assign the dataset to. The namespace helps organize related datasets and controls access and context.
5. Use the toggle to set visibility to Private or Public.
6. Click **Create dataset and upload data** to finish.

Your dataset will appear in your list of available datasets and will be ready for ingestion and cleaning.

## Create a dataset with the API or SDK

For users managing large amounts of data or integrating DataLinks into automated workflows, creating datasets through the **API** or **SDK** is the most efficient option.

You can use either:

- **A script** that calls the DataLinks API endpoint: [POST Create new dataset](/api-reference/ingest/create-new-dataset)
- Or the **DataLinks SDK**, which simplifies dataset creation in just a few lines of code.

<Info>
  For detailed instructions and code examples, visit the API reference for [**Create New Dataset**](/api-reference/ingest/create-new-dataset).

## Next Steps

Once your dataset is created, you can:

- Ingest data into it using the [**Ingest Data API**](/api-reference/ingest/ingest-data) or the web upload feature.
- Preview or validate data before committing changes.
- Begin linking datasets through DataLinks’ automatic connection features.

Creating a dataset is your first step toward transforming raw data into an intelligent, connected knowledge layer ready for AI and analysis.
