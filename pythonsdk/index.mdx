<Note>
  The Python SDK is an internal DataLinks tool that is made available for public use. It is intended for experimentation and lightweight integrations. Feature coverage and update timing may vary. For fully supported functionality and production use, please refer to the [DataLinks API documentation](/api-reference/index).
</Note>

The **DataLinks Python SDK** is designed to simplify data ingestion, normalization, linking, and querying processes with DataLinks. It integrates with the DataLinks API to provide a seamless development experience for managing data workflows, including entity resolution and inference steps, with robust configuration options.

This SDK is designed to accelerate the development of applications with DataLinks by wrapping the API integrations with a Pythonic interface, supporting flexible chaining of inference and validation steps.

Get started by [installing the SDK](/pythonsdk/sdk-install) and viewing the [QuickStart guide](/pythonsdk/sdk-quickstart).

## Features

- **Inference Workflow Management**: Define custom chains of inference and validation steps.
- **Entity Resolution**: Match entities using configurable exact or geo-based matching methods.
- **Namespace Management**: Create and manage namespaces with privacy options.
- **Data Querying**: Query data with options to include/exclude metadata.
- **Custom Loaders**: Load custom data formats like JSON into defined workflows.
- **CLI Tool**: Standardized command-line interface for managing ingestion pipelines quickly.
