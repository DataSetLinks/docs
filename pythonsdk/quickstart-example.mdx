This guide helps you create your first dataset and upload data using DataLinks. You will go from zero to a working dataset in just a few minutes.

By the end of this page, you will have:

- Created a dataset
- Uploaded data into it
- Verified that the data is available

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Python 3.9 or newer
- A Data Links API key

## Install the SDK

Install the Data Links Python SDK:

```
pip install datalinks
```

## Set your API key

Set your API key as an environment variable:

```
export DATALINKS_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

If you are on Windows, use:

```
setx DATALINKS_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```

## Create a dataset and upload data

Create a new file called `quickstart.py` and paste the following code into it.

```
from datalinks import DataLinksClient

client = DataLinksClient()

# Create a dataset
dataset = client.datasets.create(
    name="quickstart-dataset",
    description="My first Data Links dataset"
)

print(f"Created dataset with id: {dataset.id}")

# Upload data
records = [
    {"id": 1, "title": "First record", "category": "example"},
    {"id": 2, "title": "Second record", "category": "example"},
]

client.datasets.upload_data(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    records=records
)

print("Data uploaded successfully")
```

Run the script from your terminal:

```
python quickstart.py
```

## Verify your dataset

After the script finishes, you should see output similar to:

```
Created dataset with id: ds_12345
Data uploaded successfully
```

Your dataset is now created and populated with data.

You can now:

- View the dataset in the Data Links dashboard
- Query the dataset using the API or SDK
- Apply AI-powered linking and enrichment

## What just happened

In a few lines of code, you:

1. Initialized the Data Links client using your API key
2. Created a new dataset
3. Uploaded structured records into that dataset

This workflow is the foundation for most Data Links applications.

## Next steps

Once you are comfortable with this flow, you can explore:

- Updating or deleting datasets
- Uploading larger files such as CSV or JSONL
- Querying and linking data
- Using AI features on your datasets
