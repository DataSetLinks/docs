The Dataset View opens whenever you select a dataset that already contains ingested data. This page brings together everything you need to inspect records, run queries, review connections, and expand the dataset over time. The layout is organized around the following four tabs:

- **Preview & Query**
- **Connections**
- **Append new data,**
- **Data explorer**

<Check>
  You always begin on the Preview & Query tab.
</Check>

## Preview & Query

This tab provides a quick look at the dataset’s contents. Rows and columns are displayed in a scrollable table so you can confirm that your data appears as expected.

### Table preview

The main panel shows your dataset in its raw ingested form. You can scroll horizontally or vertically to explore each field. A row count beneath the table helps you understand the dataset’s size.

### Query tools

On the right side of the page, you can run queries in two ways.

- **Natural language**\
  Type a plain-language request into the query box. The system interprets your instruction and returns matching results. This option works best when you describe the filters or fields you want to see.
- **Query language**\
  Switch to the Query Language panel to write structured commands using the DataLinks query syntax. A link is provided to the full list of commands if you need reference material.

### Additional controls

At the top of the tab, you can filter columns or export the dataset as a CSV file.

## Connections

The Connections tab shows how the selected dataset links to other datasets within the same namespace. This view presents your connections as a diagram on the left side and as a list on the right.

### Visual map

The canvas displays the dataset node you are viewing along with any linked datasets. Active links appear as lines between nodes.

### Suggested links

The right panel suggests new relationships based on semantic similarity or structural hints. Each row includes a source field, a target field, a score, and a match type. Selecting a suggested row highlights it in green. A plus button appears so you can add the link.

### Active links

Existing connections appear below the suggestions. Selecting a link highlights it in red. A minus button lets you remove it.\
You can also add manual connections if you need to create a link that is not automatically suggested.

After you finish refining links, select **Save connections**.

## Append New Data

This tab lets you extend the dataset with additional files or text.

### Upload workflow

You can upload CSV, TXT, or JSON files by dragging them into the upload area or browsing your system. If the dataset already contains data, new uploads will be appended to the existing content.

### Upload options

Choose from three types of uploads:

- **Upload documents**\
  Attach structured or semi-structured files.
- **Upload free text**\
  Paste unstructured text to extract fields automatically.

### Advanced options

You can provide a helper prompt to guide the ingestion process. A prompt is useful when you want to describe the nature of the dataset or clarify the meaning of fields.

\
You also have the option to infer columns using the API or to empty the dataset if you plan to replace it entirely.

### Actions

Once everything is prepared, select **Upload data** to append the new content.

## Data Explorer

The Data Explorer offers an interactive way to explore how the selected dataset relates to others in your namespace. It focuses on traversing connections rather than editing them.

### Linked navigation

When you open the Data Explorer, you see the selected dataset and any connected datasets plotted on the workspace. You can click through to follow relationships and inspect how the data flows across the namespace.

### Record display

A preview of the dataset appears in table form so you can view rows as you navigate across connections.
