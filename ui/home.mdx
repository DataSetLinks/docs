The Home page is the first screen you see after signing in. It gives you a clear view of the data spaces your team has created and the datasets that live inside them.

## Page Layout

The interface is organized into two main sections: a left navigation panel and a central workspace.

### Left navigation menu

The navigation menu provides quick access to key areas of the platform.

- **Home:** Returns you to this main dashboard from anywhere in the application.
- **Create a new dataset:** Opens the workflow for uploading or building a new dataset.
- **Ontology Explorer:** Gives you access to semantic relationships and linked entities once your data has been interconnected.
- **Recents:** Helps you pick up where you left off by listing items you viewed or edited recently.
- **Settings:** Lets you manage personal preferences, credentials, and related account details.

At the bottom of this panel, you can view your profile, including your name and associated email address. A control is provided to collapse or expand the sidebar, depending on your preferred workspace layout.

## Central workspace: namespaces and datasets

The main area of the Home page focuses on the data available to you and your team.

### Namespace groups

Data is presented in grouped sections. Each group represents a _namespace_, which acts as a container for related datasets. Namespaces help teams organize collections of data that belong to a shared project or theme.

Each namespace card displays:

- The namespace name
- The number of datasets it contains
- The datasets themselves, shown as individual tiles
- Permissions indicators, such as lock icons when access is restricted
- A menu for namespace-level actions

### Dataset tiles

Within each namespace, datasets are displayed as separate tiles. Each tile includes:

- A dataset icon
- The dataset name
- The owner or creator of the dataset
- A permission indicator if the dataset is restricted
- An options menu for dataset actions

These tiles act as your primary entry point into working with data. Selecting a tile opens the dataset so you can review its schema, manage ingestion, or explore its connections.

## Tools and controls

### Search bar

A search field above the workspace lets you filter through visible content. You can type part of a namespace or dataset name to quickly locate what you need.

### Layout toggle

A view control next to the search bar allows you to switch between grid and list layouts. Use whichever view makes it easier to scan through your data.

## Summary

The Home page functions as your central hub. It organizes your datasets into meaningful groups, provides tools for searching and viewing, and offers quick navigation to other areas of the platform. The layout supports both exploration and focused work, giving you an efficient starting point each time you log in.
