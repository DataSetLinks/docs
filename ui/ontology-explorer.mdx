The Connections Overview helps you understand how datasets relate to each other within a namespace, and how those datasets connect to other datasets in other namespaces. It provides a visual layout of the datasets you have selected and offers tools for reviewing, adding, and removing connections (semantic links) between them.

This view is especially helpful when you want to refine how objects connect, explore inferred relationships, or adjust the structure of your context graph.

## Visual workspace

The center of the screen displays your datasets as nodes. Each node represents a dataset, and lines between nodes show existing active links. The layout adjusts automatically as you work, allowing you to zoom or pan to keep everything in view.

When you select a dataset in the workspace, the right-side panel opens to show link details. This panel is where you review suggested connections and manage the links already in place.

## Namespace selector

At the top-right corner of the page, the namespace selector lets you switch between namespaces.

When you switch namespaces, only the datasaets in that namespace and with active or suggested connections to that dataset appear.

## Saving your ontology

After adding or removing links, select **Save Ontology** to store your changes. Saving updates the semantic structure for all datasets in the namespace.

## View controls

You can manage the dataset visualtion using the view controls in the bottom-left corner of your screen.

Click the **plus (+)** or **minus (-)** buttons to zoom in or out, the **frame button** to fit all datasets in your namespace into view, and the \*\*lock button \*\*to freeze datasets in place (so you can't accidently click a dataset and select it).

## Link details panel

When you click a dataset in the Connections Overview, it opens the Link details panel, where you can manage suggested and active links.

### Suggested Links

When you click a datasett, the suggested links panel appears and lists potential relationships between fields across your datasets. These suggestions come from the platform’s semantic analysis. Each row shows:

- The source field
- The target field
- A score that reflects link relevance
- The match type

You can select a suggested link by clicking the row. When selected, the row turns green, indicating that the link is ready to be added. A plus sign appears on the right side of the row. Selecting the plus sign moves the link into the Active Links section.

You can select several suggested links at once by using the checkbox at the top of the list.

### Active links

The Active Links section shows the links that are currently part of the ontology for the selected namespace. Each active link displays:

- The source field
- The target field
- A relevance score
- The match type

If you select an active link, the row highlights in red. A minus sign appears on the right side of the row. Selecting the minus sign removes the link from the active list.

<Info>
  You can clear all selected links using the **Clear selection** option at the top of the section.

## Summary

The Ontology Explorer gives you an intuitive way to inspect and adjust how datasets connect. You can accept or reject suggested relationships, refine existing ones, and shape the knowledge structure that powers downstream analysis and semantic queries. The workspace, link panels, and controls provide a clear path for exploring and improving your ontology as your data evolves.
