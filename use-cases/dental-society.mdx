## Introduction

This guide shows you how to connect two data sources using Datalinks to uncover new sales opportunities through your existing relationships. By completing the steps yourself, you’ll learn how to create namespaces and datasets, use the SDK kit, and work within the Datalinks web platform to turn scattered data into actionable sales insights.

### Scenario

Imagine you work in dental sales and want to expand your reach by connecting with new clinics or potential partners. Rather than cold outreach, you want to discover which of your current customers are already connected to influential members of the dental community.

In this exercise, you’ll upload a structured customer list from your CRM, extract member details from a public dental society website, link the two datasets, and generate an overlap list. This list shows which of your existing customers are also society members, helping you identify people who can naturally introduce you to new contacts or opportunities within their professional network.

### Outcome

By the end of this guide, you’ll have a table showing all customers who are also members of the dental society. You can view this list directly in Datalinks or download it as a CSV file for your records.

## Prerequisites

To follow along on your machine and execute the steps in the guide, you’ll need a few things first:

4. To download a copy of this guide's [example script and data files](#).
1. A Datalinks account you can log into to obtain an API token. 

   <Info>
     Don't have an account? Contact [who](#) to request one. 
   </Info>
2. Python installed on your local machine and the package-manager pip available. To download Python, see[ the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. The Datalinks SDK installed on your machine. To install, use the following command: `pip install datalinks`.
4. A code editor to work in, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code, which is [free to download on Windows, Linux, or Mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

   <Info>
     To learn more, see the official [Datalinks SDK Installation Steps](/pythonsdk#installation).
   </Info>

With these four things in place, you're ready to get started!

## Part 1: Create your namespace and first dataset

1. Sign in to the Datalinks dashboard.
2. Click **Create New Dataset**.
3. Enter the following dataset name: `sonia_data`.

   <Info>
     Use underscores, not spaces, when naming your datasets.
   </Info>
4. Enter namespace `Demo_sonia`.
5. Ensure the Dataset visibility is set to **Private** using the toggle.
6. Click **Create dataset and upload data**.

<Check>
  Result: You've created an empty `sonia_data` dataset inside the `Demo_sonia` namespace.
</Check>

## Part 2: Upload the structured customer list

Now that you've created an empty dataset, you need to populate it with data. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click anywhere in the **Click to upload** area to open the file explorer.
2. Click the `sonia_synt.json` file you downloaded, then click **Open**.
3. Wait while Datalinks ingests your data.
4. Click the **eye icon** under Ingestion Results to review the data and confirm that everything looks correct.
5. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, then click **Upload data**.
6. Click **Append** to confirm.

<Check>
  Result: You've now populated your `sonia_data` dataset with data.
</Check>

## Part 3: Create your Datalinks API token.

1. Log in to your Datalinks account.
2. Click **Settings** in the left navigation menu.
3. Click **\+ Add a new** token.
4. Enter the name `Sonia` and set an expiration date for the token (for example, one month).
5. Click **\+ Create token**.
6. Copy and save your token. (You’ll need in later steps.)
7. Click **I’ve copied the token** to close.

## Part 4: Use a Python script with a Datalinks API key to structure the data

For the structured data you uploaded via the Datalinks web platform, you first created the dataset (Part 1), then uploaded the data for the dataset (Part 2). For the unstructured data you're working with in this section, we'll create your new dataset at the same time we upload the data into it, using a python script. 

1. Open the `infer_tabular_SONIA.py`file you downloaded earlier in your code editor.
1. Add the following information to the file:
   - On line 25, paste in your API token.
   - On line 27, enter the namespace you're using (`Demo_sonia`)
   - On line 28, enter the name for the new dataset you're creating (`Society`)
   - On line 34, update the location of the `20251009_dgoi_full.txt` if you've moved it out of the `what-name` folder your running your script from. 
   - On line 49, paste in the following prompt: 

     ```
     This is the data contained within a html from the society's DGOI page (https://www.dgoi.info/die-dgoi/mitglieder/), where the names of members (dental practices), the addresses, the phone numbers, and the websites, are included. The file contains thousands of entries. 
     # **Instructions**
     * Extract **all data** provided. 
     * **Do not skip any entry.**
     
     Whenever possible abide to the follwing schema:
     
     MemberName = this is the set of names that are used to define the member entity, which may be a person, or may be an entity like and institution, business, etc. Do the import without academic titles such as "Dr." for Doctor, "Prof." for professor and similar, and without personal honorifics like "Ms.", "Mr.", "Frau", "Herr", and extensions of these like "Miss".
     
     AcademicTitle = this is a Academic honorific (e.g. "Dr." for Doctor, "Prof." for professor) that can be extracted before the name.
     
     Address = this is the street address belonging to the member name.
     
     city = this is the name of the city to which the address belongs to.
     
     Country = this is the name of the country to which the address belongs to. Normalize all names to English.
     
     Geo = these are the geographical coordinates that you need to calculate from the Address. These include latitude and longitude.
     
     Phone = this is the phone number associated with the member name. If it does not contain the country code (+XX) add the respective country code based on country of member. Pay attention to which country we are dealing with and substitute the leading 0 by the country code when appropriate.
     
     WebSite = this is the web address associated with the member name.
     ```
3. Verify everything looks correct, then save your file.
4. Run your python program. (In Visual Studio Code, press the play icon in the top-right corner of your screen.)
5. Wait for the data to finish uploading. This may take 10-20 minutes.
