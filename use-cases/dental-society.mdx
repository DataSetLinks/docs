title: "How to Use Datalinks for Expanding Sales Channels: A Scenario-Based Guide"
description: "Connect structured and unstructured data to identify new sales opportunities."
---

## Introduction

This guide shows you how to connect two data sources using Datalinks to uncover new sales opportunities through your existing relationships. By completing the steps yourself, you’ll learn how to create namespaces and datasets, use the SDK kit, and work within the Datalinks web platform to turn scattered data into actionable sales insights.

### Scenario

Imagine you work in dental sales and want to expand your reach by connecting with new clinics or potential partners. Rather than cold outreach, you want to discover which of your current customers are already connected to influential members of the dental community.

In this exercise, you’ll upload a structured customer list from your CRM, extract member details from a public dental society website, link the two datasets, and generate an overlap list. This list shows which of your existing customers are also society members, helping you identify people who can naturally introduce you to new contacts or opportunities within their professional network.

### Outcome

By the end of this guide, you’ll have a table showing all customers who are also members of the dental society. You can view this list directly in Datalinks or download it as a CSV file for your records.

## Prerequisites

To follow along on your machine and execute the steps in the guide, you’ll need a few things:

1. A Datalinks account you can log into to obtain an API token. If you don't have one, contact **WHO?**
2. You’ll need to have Python installed on your local machine and the package-manager pip available. To download Python, see[ the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
3. The Datalinks SDK installed on your machine. To install, follow our official [Datalinks SDK Installation Steps](/pythonsdk#installation). 
4. To download [these script and data files](#). 

## Part 1: Create your namespace and first dataset

1. Sign in to the Datalinks dashboard.
2. Click **Create New Dataset**.
3. Enter the following dataset name: `sonia_data`.

   <Info>
     Use underscores, not spaces, when naming your datasets.
   </Info>
4. Enter namespace `Demo_sonia`.
5. Ensure the Dataset visibility is set to **Private** using the toggle.
6. Click **Create dataset and upload data**.

<Check>
  Result: You've created an empty `sonia_data` dataset inside the `Demo_sonia` namespace.
</Check>

## Part 2: Upload the structured customer list

Now that you've created an empty dataset, you need to populate it with data. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click anywhere in the **Click to upload** area to open the file explorer.
2. Click the `sonia_synt.json` file you downloaded, then click **Open**.
3. Wait while Datalinks ingests your data.
4. Click the **eye icon** under Ingestion Results to review the data and confirm that everything looks correct.
5. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, then click **Upload data**.
6. Click **Append** to confirm.

<Check>
  Result: You're taken to the Dataset Overview page, showing the Preview & Query tab.
</Check>

## Part 3: Create your Datalinks API token.

1. Log in to your Datalinks account.
2. Click **Settings** in the left navigation menu.
3. Click **\+ Add a new** token.
4. Enter the name `Sonia` and set an expiration date for the token (for example, one month).
5. Click **\+ Create token**.
6. Copy and save your token. (You’ll need in later steps.)
7. Click **I’ve copied the token** to close.

## Part 4: Use a Python script with a Datalinks API key to structure the data

Included in the package you

1. Download the following `.py` file to your local machine:
2. In your working python folder, add it to the src folder.
3. Take the text file you created in Part 3 and place it in the data folder.
4. Open the `infer_tabular_SONIA` file and make the following changes:
   1. On Line z, change x to y
   2. On Line z, change x to y
   3. On Line z, change x to y
1. When everything is entered, run the script.
