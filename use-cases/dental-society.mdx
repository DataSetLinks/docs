description: "Connect structured and unstructured data to identify new sales opportunities."

## Introduction

This guide shows you how to connect two data sources to uncover new sales opportunities through your existing relationships. By completing the steps yourself, you’ll learn how to create namespaces and datasets, use the SDK kit, and work within the Datalinks web platform to turn scattered data into actionable insights.

### Scenario

Imagine you work in dental sales and want to expand your reach by connecting with new clinics or potential partners. Rather than cold outreach, you want to discover which of your current customers are already connected to influential members of the dental community.

In this exercise, you’ll upload a structured customer list from your CRM, extract member details from a public dental society website, link the two datasets, and generate an overlap list. This list shows which of your existing customers are also society members, helping you identify people who can naturally introduce you to new contacts or opportunities within their professional network.

### Prerequisites

To follow along on your machine and execute the steps in the guide, you’ll need a few things:

1. A Datalinks account you can log into to obtain an API key.
2. Python installed on your local machine.
3. The Datalinks SDK installed on your machine.

### Why this matters

Customer information often lives in CRMs or spreadsheets, while influential industry contacts are stored in other sources like society rosters or event programs. Datalinks helps you connect these scattered sources, revealing where your existing customers and key industry members intersect.

### Outcome

By the end of this guide, you’ll have a table showing all customers who are also members of the dental society. You can view this list directly in Datalinks or download it as a CSV file for your records.

## Part 1: Create your namespace and first dataset

1. Sign in to the Datalinks dashboard.
2. Click **Create New Dataset**.
3. Enter dataset name `sonia_data`. 

   <Tip>
     Use underscores, not spaces, when naming your datasets.
   </Tip>
4. Enter namespace `Demo_sonia`.
5. Ensure the Dataset visibility is set to **Private** using the toggle.
6. Click **Create dataset and upload data**.

<Check>
  An empty `sonia_data` dataset inside the `Demo_sonia` namespace is created.
</Check>

## Part 2. Upload the structured customer list

1. Click anywhere in the **Click to upload** area to open the file explorer.
2. Select your downloaded copy of the `sonia_synt.json` file, then click **Open**.
3. Wait while Datalinks ingests your data.
4. Click the **eye icon** under Ingestion Results to review the data and confirm that everything looks correct.
5. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, then click **Upload data**.

Result: You are taken to dataset overview page, where you can now preview and query your customer data, view connections, append new data, or open the Data explorer.

## Part 3. Create a TXT file with unstructured data

In this step, you’ll use publicly-available unstructured data from a dental society website to create a structured table that you can then work with.

1. In a new browser window, open the following website: https://www.dgoi.info/die-dgoi/mitglieder
2. Use your mouse to select all the society member information on the left side of the screen, then **copy** it.
3. Create a new TXT file on your local machine and name it `date-dgoi.txt`.
4. **Paste** the society member data into the file and save it somewhere convenient.

## Part 4. Obtain your Datalinks API key.

1. Log in to your Datalinks account.
2. Click **Settings** in the left navigation menu.
3. Click **\+ Add a new** token.
4. Enter the name `Sonia` and set an expiration date for the token.
5. Click **\+ Create token**.
6. Copy and save your token. (You’ll need in later steps.)
7. Click **I’ve copied the token** to close.

## Part 5. Use a Python script with a Datalinks API key to structure the data

1. Download the following `.py` file to your local machine:
2. In your working python folder, add it to the src folder.
3. Take the text file you created in Part 3 and place it in the data folder.
4. Open the `infer_tabular_SONIA` file and make the following changes:
   1. On Line z, change x to y
   2. On Line z, change x to y
   3. On Line z, change x to y
5. When everything is entered, run the script.
