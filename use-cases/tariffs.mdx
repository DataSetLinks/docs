### Accessing Tariff Information for International Trade

**About**: This service demonstrates how to use the DataLinks platform as a base of a product. It provides up-to-date tariff rates, regulations, and related information to help businesses make informed decisions about importing and exporting goods. All accessible with natural language queries

### **Example Query**

You can query tariff information using natural language. For example:

```
"Import steel from Spain to the US"
```

This query will return relevant tariff information for steel products being imported from Spain to the United States.

### **How It Works**

The tariff service uses the DataLinks platform to:

1. Process natural language queries about tariffs
2. Search through comprehensive tariff databases
3. Return relevant, up-to-date tariff information
4. Charge users based on usage (per query)
